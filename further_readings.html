                <h4>The Poetic Edda</h4>
                <div class="sourceimage">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Edda-Stories-Hackett-Classics/dp/1624663567"><img src="images/poetic_edda.jpg" alt="Poetic Edda" /></a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The Poetic Edda is considered one of the two greatest sources of information available for understanding Norse Mythology. This collection of stories includes myths such as the telling of the coming
                    of Ragnarok, the binding of Loki, and the fishing of Jormungandr by Thor.

                    My favorite translation is the one by Jackson Crawford. The book can be ordered on Amazon in digital, physical, and audiobook form here:
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Edda-Stories-Hackett-Classics/dp/1624663567">Poetic Edda by Jackson Crawford</a>
                </p>
                <br class="clear" />
                <h4>The Prose Edda</h4>
                <div class="sourceimage">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edda-Everymans-Library-Snorri-Sturluson/dp/0460876163/"><img src="images/prose_edda.jpg" alt="Prose Edda" /></a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The Prose Edda is considered the other of the two greatest sources we have available for understanding Norse Mythology. Yet another collection of stories, this one includes the Gylfaginning,
                    Skaldskaparmal, and Hattatal by Snorri Sturluson, detailing many more tales of the Gods and great heroes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My preferred translation is by Anthony Faulkes in the Everyman Edda, available in digital and physical form here:
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edda-Everymans-Library-Snorri-Sturluson/dp/0460876163/">Edda (Everyman's Library)</a>
                </p>
                <br class="clear" />
                <h4>Saga of the Volsungs</h4>
                <div class="sourceimage">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Volsungs-Lothbrok-Hackett-Classics/dp/1624666337/"><img src="images/saga_of_the_volsungs.jpg" alt="Saga of the Volsungs" /></a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The Saga of the Volsungs is a story detailing the heroics of the Volsung family over seven generations. The two sagas are a perfect way to look further into Norse legend, past the ever-lasting gods
                    that make up the mythology and toward the heroes living in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet another wonderful translation has been done by Jackson Crawford, available in digital, physical, and audiobook form here:
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Volsungs-Lothbrok-Hackett-Classics/dp/1624666337/">Saga of the Volsungs by Jackson Crawford</a>
                </p>
                <br class="clear" />
                <h4>The Viking Spirit</h4>
                <div class="sourceimage">
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1533393036/"><img src="images/the_viking_spirit.jpg" alt="The Viking Spirit" /></a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Breaking away from the primary sources, we have The Viking Spirit. This book by Daniel McCoy is the perfect introduction to Norse mythology for any curious mind. The first half of the book goes
                    over the culture that the Norse lived in, while the second half is full of some of the greatest Norse stories presented in an easy-to-digest form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book can be found here in digital, physical, and audiobook form:
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1533393036/">The Viking Spirit by Daniel McCoy</a>

                    Jackson Crawford, who made translations for both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda also has a YouTube channel where he goes over almost anything you could want to know related to Old Norse culture, 
                    including the myths, the runes, pronunciations, society, and more. You aren't likely to find a better free source of information on the topic than here.
