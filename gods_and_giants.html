                <h1>Gods and Giants in Norse Mythology</h1>
                <h2>Powerful, but Not All-Powerful</h2>
                <p>
                    Gods and giants in Norse mythology are beings who often display imense feats of power, which sometimes even defy the laws of reality themself, but compared to other more well-known pantheons sunch as Greek 
                    or Egyptian, the gods in Norse mythology are limited. They are clearly mortal, and that combined with the knowledge many have of their fates at Ragnarok often plays a pivotal role in their behavior. They also 
                    rarely have complete dominion over anything. Odin may have helped create the world, but that doesn't give him control of the land and the sky. These limitations bring the expectations toward the gods closer 
                    in line with something a person believing in the mythology could relate to.
                </p>
                <h2>Gods</h2>
                <p>
                    The gods are split into two categories, the Aesir and the Vanir. The former are seen as more battle-driven and are the major focus of a larger portion of the myths. Gods like Odin, Thor, and Tyr fall in 
                    this category. The Vanir are generally more peaceful and have a stronger emphasis on magic. These include gods such as Freyja and Freyr.
                </p>
                <h2>Giants</h2>
                <p>
                    The Giants, or J&ouml;tunn, are an interesting case. They are generally powerful entities, and are often very large as the name suggests, but the distinction between them and the gods can be somewhat hazy at times. 
                    J&ouml;tunns are often depicted as evil as well, though this is not a hard rule. They often become the spouces of gods in the mythology, and sometimes even father or mother one or more gods.
